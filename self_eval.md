# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel really confident about understanding comparison operators, and I feel like the fluency will come with repetition

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I feel like I understand what they mean and how they work. I think I need more practice and to watch others do it more, before I will feel fluent.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I feel like I understand the if statements, but I am having a hard time putting it to practice. I also feel like there are many commands that I dont know. Like the ! in front of a boolean statement can mean the opposite of whatever the assigned variable is. 

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I spent 2+ hours on it. I thought it took way longer than it should. One part of that is testing. I didnt realize that I could test in ruby with out doing git add and git commit everytime

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to practice using short cuts, and also learning more of them. I need more practice, because I need the reps in order to feel fluent. 

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Are all homework assignments going to have things in them that we have not discussed? That is really slowing me down. Im taking notes throughout class, but then when I get to some assignments, they have all new things that we didnt talk about AT ALL!
